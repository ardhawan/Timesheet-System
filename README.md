# Timesheet-System
Each year, the Discipline of Computing recruits a number of undergraduate and postgraduate students to fulfil the role of Lab Assistants or to assist with marking of student assignments. Variousadministration tasks haveto be completedduring this process. For example, applications for temporary work contracts must be submitted to the University of Dundee for the students concerned. Later, when contracts are in place,students must submit monthly timesheets with details of the hours they have worked in order to claim payment. The time sheets are reviewed and signed by members of teaching staff. Currently,these processes are paper-based or reliant on sending documents around as attachments to obtain signatures and details from various people which creates overheads and increases the risk of things being overlooked or lost in inboxes. The purpose of this project is to research and develop a web site (or similarapplication) to automate theprocess of submitting time sheets. This will include allowing students/ lab assistants to submit and manage their timesheets, allowing members of staff to review the time sheets (and record that they have done so), providing time sheets in a format that can be submitted to the University Human Resources department, and other general functionality that may be desirable, e.g. information about timesheet deadlines, stats or overviews about hours worked and hours verified for various students, and so on.
